## assignment1

In the first [assignment](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/tree/master/assignment1) I was learning to use Github. It contains files that I used for my learning. E.g. how to make a commit or how to recover old version of the files. 

## assignment2

[Assignment2](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/tree/master/assignment2) contains two bash shell scripts: 

- The [move.sh](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment2/move.sh) script that moves all the files from one directory to another directory. 
- The [track.sh](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment2/track.sh) script thst tracks the time used on the spesific task. 

## assignment3

[Assignment3](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/tree/master/assignment3) contains two Python scripts:

- The [Array.py](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment3/Array.py) script that converts values into a 1D or 2D array without using Numpy. 
- The [test_Array.py](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment3/test_Array.py) script that checks if every functionality of Array.py works as it should.
