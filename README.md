## Problem Solving with High-Level Languages

>This course provides an introduction to more advanced aspects of the scripting and programming language Python, e.g. object-oriented programming, regular expressions, interaction with the operating system, platform-independent code, efficient design of program systems with time-critical operations, extensions in compiled languages such as C/C++, data analysis and web programming. The course also provides a basic introduction to the scripting language Bash, testing and documentation of code, and version control system git. Special emphasis is placed on practical problem solving with a focus on interesting and study-relevant tasks.

After taking this course you'll:
- Have knowledge of more advanced aspects of the Python programming language, including the use of regular expressions and interaction with the operating system
- Be able to write scripts in Python and Bash to automate your own work tasks
- Have knowledge of the version control system git and how code can be documented and tested
- Be able to use vectorization to write efficient programs in Python
- Be able to combine Python with compiled programming languages such as C and C++
- Be able to write a web user interface for Python programs
- Be able to use Python tools for advanced data analysis and machine learning
- Be able to write programs that solve problems from different disciplines, such as physics, medicine, biology and finance

## assignment1

In the first [assignment](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/tree/master/assignment1) I was learning to use Github. It contains files that I used for my learning. E.g. how to make a commit or how to recover old version of the files. 

## assignment2

[Assignment2](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/tree/master/assignment2) contains two bash shell scripts: 

- The [move.sh](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment2/move.sh) script that moves all the files from one directory to another directory. 
- The [track.sh](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment2/track.sh) script thst tracks the time used on the spesific task. 

## assignment3

[Assignment3](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/tree/master/assignment3) contains two Python scripts:

- The [Array.py](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment3/Array.py) script that converts values into a 1D or 2D array without using Numpy. 
- The [test_Array.py](https://github.uio.no/IN3110/IN3110-klaudiap/blob/master/assignment3/test_Array.py) script that checks if every functionality of Array.py works as it should.
